This project provides the scripts to install, to set up and run tests using OpenBACH.

This project does not prevent the reader from looking at [OpenBACH installation manual](https://wiki.net4sat.org/doku.php?id=openbach:manuals:2.x:installation_manual:index).

By cloning the current repository, the user can:

1. run the `00-install.sh` script to install OpenBACH
1. run the `10-setup-project.sh` script to set up an OpenBACH project

Based on this, the user can either use the auditorium scripts, the IHM or the provided scripts `20-run.sh` to build and run scenarios.

Three NUCs are exploited and the network architecture is showed below.
