This project provides the scripts to install, to set up and run tests using OpenBACH.
These scripts assumes that the openbach, openbach-extra and openbach-3nuc repositories are at the same level. 

As one example: 

`toto@my-computer:~/Desktop$ ls`

`openbach  openbach-3nuc  openbach-extra`

Three NUCs are exploited and the network architecture is showed below.
